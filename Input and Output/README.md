# C++ Input and Output - HackerRank Challenge

## Problem Statement:

The task is to take three integers as input (`num1`, `num2`, and `num3`), calculate their sum, and print the result.

## Solution:

### Algorithm:

1. **Variable Declaration:**
   - Three variables (`num1`, `num2`, and `num3`) are declared to store the input integers.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program takes three integers as input using `cin` and stores them in the declared variables.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum of the three input numbers (`num1 + num2 + num3`).

4. **Output:**
   - The calculated sum is printed using `cout`.

### Running the Code:

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your machine.

2. **Compile and Run:**
   - Save the provided code in a file with a `.cpp` extension (e.g., `sum_of_three.cpp`).
   - Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the file.
   - Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ sum_of_three.cpp -o sum_of_three`).
   - Run the executable (e.g., `./sum_of_three`).
   - Enter three integers when prompted.

### Explanation:

- The code declares three variables to store input integers and calculates their sum.
- It uses `cin` for input and `cout` for output.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- Time Complexity: O(1) - Constant time, as it performs a fixed number of operations.
- Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space, as the number of declared variables is constant.

### Note:

- This solution assumes that the input values are valid integers. If there's a possibility of invalid input, additional input validation may be needed.
